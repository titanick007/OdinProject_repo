        <h1>Do I know guitar???!!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Yes!! I do know how to play the guitar. My level would be around intermediate.
            <br>
            I started learning the guitar because the worship leader in my church wanted to teach a few of the kids in the church.
            <br>
            So I started learning in 6th grade. I learnt the basics within about 6 months to a year.
            <br>
            After that I stagnated because my parents never forced me to go to any guitar lessons or anything.
            <br>
            But around 11th grade my dad bought me an electric guitar because of my good grades in 10th grade.
            <br>
            That really motivated me to take my guitar skills to another level.
